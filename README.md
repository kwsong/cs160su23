# CS 160: User Interface Design and Development
### Summer 2023

&nbsp;

Welcome to CS 160! CS 160 is the introductory course to the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). In this class, students will learn to design, prototype and evaluate user interfaces. Unlike most classes, CS 160 will not focus on any particular set of algorithmic techniques. Instead, students will learn techniques for user-centered interface design (e.g., prototyping, contextual inquiry, heuristic evaluation, etc.). This summer, we will learn how to use front-end web development technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and a backend for prototyping.

The course features two parts: (1) five weeks of curriculum and practice, and (2) three weeks of a final project.

The instructors for this summer’s CS 160 course are Ace Chen, Katherine Song, and Hridhay Suresh.
