I am a CS PhD student working with Eric Paulos in the [Hybrid Ecologies Lab](https://www.hybrid-ecologies.org) on degradable electronics and the sustainable making+unmaking of tangible interactive systems. Outside of research/teaching, I like to run on trails and climb on rocks. My office hours are Tuesday and Thursday 9:30-11am (by appointment).
