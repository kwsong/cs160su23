Hello awesome CS160 people! I'm Noah (any pronouns) and I'll be one of your Readers for this summer. Feel free to reach out to me anytime regarding grading questions and/or tips on how to improve in this course as we go forward! Or even as just a friend to help you on this exciting journey you're beginning with user interface design! I want to be here for you, so please feel comfortable reaching out :). One fun fact about myself: I am learning the piano but I'm very bad at it. I wish you all the best in this course!!!
