Helloo:) My name is Pradeep and I think HCI is really cool! I'm currently part of Berkeley Institute of Design, where I get to explore the intersection between CS and design. I also make films as a hobby! I'm looking forward to meeting everyone and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about the course (or if you wanna play tennis/badminton with me hehe). My office hours are 2-3pm on Wednesdays.
