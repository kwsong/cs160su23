**DSP Point of Contact**  
Hello. I am an n-th year CS major with an emphasis in HCI and CS education.  Outside of this class, I spend time solving rubikâ€™s cubes one-handed, playing Guitar Hero competitively, and studying for the GRE.  I have walk-in Office Hours from 2:00 - 3:30 PM in Cory 284 and on Zoom by request.  Feel free to come over and say hi!
