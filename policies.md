## Overview

### Curriculum and Practice
For the first five weeks, **lecture** occurs three days a week (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday), **studio** once a week (Mondays during lecture time), and **section** (optional) occurs twice a week. While lectures and studio focus on introducing core HCI concepts, sections reinforce these concepts and help students improve technical skills. Outside of class, students will work individually or in pairs on weekly projects. Weekly projects allow students to engage in the design cycle and develop technical skills.

### Final Project
Using design methodologies and technical skills learned during the first five weeks, students will work in groups for the last three weeks to ideate, prototype and implement a final project. Students will choose their own design methodologies and project topic within a theme. During the last three weeks, final project studio will take the place of lecture and studio on Monday-Thursday. Final project studio provides in-class time for teams to work together and receive feedback from course staff.

## Weekly Format
### Lectures and Studios
We will have lectures/studios on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday from **11:00am to 12:30pm** in **Jacobs 310** every week. Studios will be led by the CS 160 Teaching Assistants, and lectures will be taught by the Instructors. A general weekly schedule can be found below:

- Monday: Studio
- Tuesday: Lecture
- Wednesday: Lecture
- Thursday: Lecture

CS 160 is a hands-on class that requires collaborative work and discussion. As such, attending studio and lecture is mandatory and part of your grade. Opportunities to make up an absence are only available for extenuating circumstances (e.g., documented DSP exceptions or unforeseen illness with documentation).

Lecture slides can be found in the Lectures subfolder of the student-facing Drive folder.

### Discussion Sections
Each week, we will cover 2 topics ("A" and "B" in the Weekly Schedule) useful for completing current or upcoming assignments. We will offer a total of 6 sections every week, allotting 3 sections per topic. Discussion section attendance is optional and is not counted towards your grade. However, we recommend that students try to attend 1 Section A and 1 Section B each week to get the most of the concepts taught in these offerings and be prepared for upcoming assignments.

Section slide PDFs can be found in the Section subfolder of the student-facing Drive folder.

## Office Hours
Office Hours will be posted on our Google Calendar.

## Attendance and Participation
You are expected to attend all lectures and all studios in their entirety. Everything that we say in class may be included in any assessment and may be difficult to obtain through other channels. During or after lectures or studio, you may be expected to complete an assignment that will be simple to complete for those in attendance. Studio sessions and any breakout room discussions will not be recorded. Lectures will be recorded, and recordings will be made available on the course syllabus page.

Sections are not required, but we anticipate in many cases they will be extremely useful to your success in the course and beyond. Make sure you do not have conflicts with at least one section time for each topic so you can get timely help preparing for assignments and practicing skills.

There are 30 total participation points – participating in a lecture or studio session earns you 1 participation point. You need only 20/30 participation points to receive a full participation grade. You can also earn participation points by being active on the course Slack. At the end of the course, excellent participation will be taken into account for students with borderline final grades.

## Accounts

| Site     | Purpose	     | Description     |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| Slack	| Discussion and Design Archive	| Make sure you join the course Slack, and are receiving notifications. You will document your projects on our Slack workspace. This will let us have a shared archive of everyone’s designs that everyone can view.|
| bCourses	| Assignment Submissions	| You will submit links to your projects and receive grades through bCourses. Note that we will NOT use bCourses for announcements; make sure you are subscribed to Piazza.|
| GitHub	| Project Code	| You will create your project code repositories through our course Github page. This lets us distribute starter code, and keeps all the projects in the same place.|

## Grading Policy

Final grades will be determined with the following breakdown:

**30% Weekly projects:** The weekly projects each consist of Design Cycle Checkpoints. Each checkpoint will be graded independently with a detailed rubric. These rubrics will be released with the grades. All submissions should adhere to the guidelines for successful submissions.

**30% Final project:** Final projects take place during the last three weeks of class in assigned groups of 4-6. For grading, we will take into account several aspects of the final project process: teamwork and participation, design checkpoints, observation/need-finding, evaluation, implementation, and deliverables (e.g., presentation, poster, article).

**20% Participation:** Your participation grade is determined based on your attendance, preparation, and participation in class and studio, and the feedback you provide on your peers’ designs. It is also determined by your activity on the course Slack. Studio takes place on Mondays, then Mon-Thurs for the last 3 weeks of class, and you will provide feedback on peers’ designs.

**20% Assessments:** Every week for the first 6 weeks, there will be a quiz. The quiz will cover content throughout the week, so we encourage you to complete it progressively during the week instead of waiting until the end. It will be multiple choice and short answer, and will cover lecture material (including breakout room prompts), readings from any prior week, and readings from the current week. There is no midterm or final exam.

The grading bins will follow the following bins:

| Grade        | Range          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| A            | [93, 100] |
| A-           | [90, 93)   |
| B+           | [87, 90) |
| B            | [83, 87)   |
| B-           | [80, 83) |
| C+           | [77, 80)   |
| C            | [73, 77) |
| C-           | [70, 73)   |
| D+           | [67, 70)   |
| D            | [63, 67) |
| D-           | [60, 63)   |
| F           | [0, 60)   |


If the class grade distribution ends up being too low relative to [EECS grading guidelines](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/faculty-staff/academic-personnel/grading-guidelines-undergrad), we may curve grades upwards. We will not curve grades down. And remember, we’ll take high participation into account for students on the borderline!

## Credits
The syllabus, lecture slides, web content, and assignments of this course are only the most recent iterations of a long history of HCI classes. This iteration of the course, at the very least, draws from prior course materials by Shm Almeda, Nate Weinmann, Janaki Vivrekar, Sarah Sterman, Andrew Head, Amy Pavel, Cesar Torres, Björn Hartmann, Eric Paulos, Valkyrie Savage, Maneesh Agrawala, Scott Klemmer, John Canny, and James Landay.
