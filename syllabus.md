## Course Components
A day by day schedule of topics for the whole summer can be found [here](../schedule). A general weekly schedule of lectures, studios, and discussion times can be found [here](../weekly).

### Lectures and Studios
We will have lectures/studios on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday from **11:00am to 12:30pm** in **Jacobs 310** every week. Studios will be led by the CS 160 Teaching Assistants, and lectures will be taught by the Instructors. Lectures and studios focus on introducing core HCI concepts and implementing them in practice through projects.

For the first five weeks, **lecture** occurs three days a week (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday), **studio** occurs once a week (Mondays during lecture time). For the last three weeks, studio occurs four days a week (Monday-Thursday), with a few lectures interspersed throughout.

Lecture slides will be posted before the beginning of each lecture. Lectures will not be recorded.

### Discussion Sections
Each week, we will cover 2 topics ("A" and "B" in the Weekly Schedule) needed to complete current or upcoming assignments. While lectures and studio focus on introducing core HCI concepts, sections reinforce these concepts and help students improve technical skills. We will offer a total of 6 sections every week, allotting 3 sections per topic. You must attend 1 "A" section and 1 "B" section each week. See [below](#attendance-and-participation-policy) for the detailed attendance policy.

Section slide PDFs will be available in the Section subfolder of the student-facing Drive folder at the end of each week.

### Readings
Each week, we will post a handful of readings related to the material covered in lecture that week. Weekly quizzes (see below) will assess your understanding of the readings, and you will be expected to incorporate the information in your project designs.

There is no textbook for this class.

### Quizzes
Every week for the first 6 weeks, there will be a quiz that is released on bCourses on Monday and due on Friday (11:59PM) -- the exception to this is Quiz 1, which is due on Sunday 6/25 at 11:59PM. The quiz will cover content throughout the week, so we encourage you to complete it progressively during the week instead of waiting until the end. It will be a combination of multiple choice and free-form answer questions and will cover lecture material, readings from any prior week, and readings from the current week. You are permitted to draw upon your notes and any materials you find with proper citation, but you must complete quizzes on your own and are not permitted to work on them with other people.

There is no midterm or final exam.

### Projects
Projects allow students to engage in the design cycle and develop technical skills. In the first 5 weeks, there will be 4 projects, the first 2 of which are completed individually, and last 2 of which are completed in pairs. 

### Final Project
Using design methodologies and technical skills learned during the first five weeks, students will work in groups of 3-4 for the last three weeks to ideate, prototype and implement a final project. Students will choose their own design methodologies and project topic within a theme. During the last three weeks, final project studio will take the place of lecture and studio on Monday-Thursday. Final project studio provides in-class time for teams to work together and receive feedback from course staff.

### Midterm Check-in, Final Evaluation, and Peer Assessments
There will be a midterm and final course survey distributed during Week 4 and 8, respectively, to help us understand how the course is going for you and how to improve it in future iterations. Completion of these surveys will allow you to drop your lowest quiz score (see [Grade Breakdown](#grade-breakdown)).

At the end of each group project (Project 3, Project 4, and the Final Project), you will also be asked to complete a Peer Assessment letting us know how things went from your perspective. This will be a part of your project grade and will be used to adjust individual scores within groups, if necessary.

## Required Materials and Technology

### Sketching and Prototyping Supplies
There is no required textbook for this class. However, we request that you obtain a small set of design supplies to help you deliver legible sketches, prototypes, and critique. All materials can be purchased at Berkeley craft or school supply stores like [Blick Art Materials](https://www.yelp.com/biz/blick-art-materials-berkeley), [the campus store](https://the-campus-store.business.site/), or [The Ink Stone](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ink-stone-berkeley). You might also find them in the school supply section of your local supermarket or drugstore.  

These supplies can also easily be found online (examples are linked below, but please feel free to find comparable ones).  

If purchasing any of these materials presents financial difficulty, please reach out to us on Slack.

## Attendance and Participation Policy

CS 160 is a hands-on class that requires collaborative work and discussion. As such, we expect everyone to attend all studios, all lectures, and 2 discussions a week (1 on Topic A, and 1 on Topic B).

You are expected to attend lectures, studios, and discussions in their entirety. You are considered late if you are not physically present in the room by Berkeley time (10 min past the hour). Everything that we say in class may be included in any assessment and may be difficult to obtain through other channels. At a random point during lectures, studios, or discussions, you may be expected to complete an assignment that will be simple to complete for those in attendance. Lectures, studios, and discussions will not be recorded except in special circumstances.

If you must miss a lecture, studio, or discussion due to an unforeseen health-related circumstance or emergency, you should submit an [Excused Absence Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc1Cu9lOdId3kL48Y8fbfAhaGPYJ-YvQl42NlirfLInUAyW9A/viewform) before the beginning of class. If your absence is excused, we will do our best to help you make up what you missed.

You may have up to 3 unexcused absences (no questions asked) over the summer without incurring a grade penalty. Note that this includes absences across all lectures, studios, and discussions. For more *unexcused* absences, your final grade in the class will be impacted as follows:

| # Unexcused Absences        | Penalty          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| 3 or fewer           | none   |
| 4-5            | 1 grade step (e.g. A to A-; A- to B+; B+ to B; etc.) |
| 6-7           | 2 grade steps (e.g. A to B+; A- to B; B+ to B-; etc.)   |
| 8-9           | 3 grade steps (e.g. A to B; A- to B-; B+ to C+; etc.) |
| 10 or more            | 4 grade steps (e.g. A to B-; A- to C+; B+ to C; etc.)   |

We expect you to participate by contributing to activities in lecture, studio, and discussion and/or by being active on the course Slack. Each project will have a small number of points allocated for participation, which will comprise critiquing your peers' work in a timely and thoughtful manner. At the end of the course, excellent participation will be taken into account for students with borderline final grades.

---

## Grading

### Grade Breakdown
Final grades will be determined with the following breakdown:

**40% Projects:** The 4 projects (each worth 10% of your final grade) will be graded with a detailed rubric. These rubrics will be released with the grades. All submissions should adhere to the guidelines for full credit. Projects 3 and 4 are pair projects and will be submitted with a peer feedback assessment. Barring unusual circumstances that are brought to the attention of the instructors, pairs should expect to receive the same grade on pair projects.

**35% Final project:** Final projects take place during the last three weeks of class in assigned groups of 4-6. For grading, we will take into account several aspects of the final project process: teamwork and participation, observation/need-finding, evaluation, implementation, and deliverables (e.g., presentation, poster, article). A peer feedback assessment form will be submitted with the final project that will help us determine if any individual grade adjustments must be made.

**25% Quizzes:** There will be 6 weekly quizzes, the lowest grade of which will be dropped as long as you complete a midterm and final course survey. The average of your quiz scores will make up 25% of your final grade (so if you complete the midterm and final surveys, each quiz will be worth 5% of your total grade). There is no midterm or final exam.

The grading bins will follow the following bins:

| Grade        | Range          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| A            | [93, 100] |
| A-           | [90, 93)   |
| B+           | [87, 90) |
| B            | [83, 87)   |
| B-           | [80, 83) |
| C+           | [77, 80)   |
| C            | [73, 77) |
| C-           | [70, 73)   |
| D+           | [67, 70)   |
| D            | [63, 67) |
| D-           | [60, 63)   |
| F           | [0, 60)   |


If the class grade distribution ends up being too low relative to [EECS grading guidelines](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/faculty-staff/academic-personnel/grading-guidelines-undergrad), we may curve grades upwards. We will not curve grades down. We will take high participation into account for borderline cases!

### Regrade Requests
If you want a quiz or project regraded, you submit a [Regrade Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScepeTAfC3OZ6Kv9eGezeeHVt9u2LXlZLAUYzYgfYFhn9k2HA/viewform), no sooner than two days but within two weeks after receiving the grade. Staff will regrade the entire assignment; this means that your grade may potentially drop.

---

## Deadlines and Extensions
Deadlines are 11:59PM on the day listed in the [course schedule](../schedule). However, project deadlines are "squishy": if you need an extension, file an [Extension Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQXEIBV7eZHYYihUmsK5C1eVPmt9lze5hp2UZ8wEZzgVPAGQ/viewform) *by the official deadline*. For individual projects (Projects 1 and 2), we will automatically approve extension requests of up to 24 hours (or 48 hours with documented DSP accommodations). For group projects (Projects 3 and 4), we will automatically approve extension requests of up to 48 hours; only 1 person in the group needs to submit a request. Extensions longer than these will be considered on a case-by-case basis. There will be no extensions on final project deliverables. If you do not file an Extension Request by the deadline, you (and/or your team) will receive a 25% penalty per undocumented late day on that project. Quiz deadlines (11:59PM on Fridays except Quiz 1, which is due on Sunday) are "hard": you may submit an [Extension Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQXEIBV7eZHYYihUmsK5C1eVPmt9lze5hp2UZ8wEZzgVPAGQ/viewform) if you have an extenuating circumstance, but consideration will be on a case-by-case basis; start your quizzes early (see [quizzes](#quizzes))!

---

## Course Culture

### Group Work
When you work in pairs and groups, each group is responsible for making sure that all members are participating. After each project, you will be asked to describe the effort put in by each member of the group, both on specific tasks and as a fraction of the group’s effort. Make sure you discuss this regularly, to make sure your group is in agreement about the work breakdown.

If a group member is not participating, the entire group must meet with the teaching staff. Effective group work, which entails some amount of conflict resolution, is a key skill for success after this class. We would like you to work through conflicts if at all possible, and we will devote some class time to this topic.

### Laptops and Hand-Held Devices
Laptops and hand-held devices are permitted for note-taking, documentation, and brainstorming during most lectures, studios, and sections. However, during live critiques, you are expected to close laptops and put away hand-held devices so that you may give your peers your full attention. Failure to do repeatedly may result in a loss of attendance credit.

### Etiquette for Dropping the Course
The majority of the work in this course is conducted in pairs and groups. Dropping the course in the middle of a project will have negative consequences for your peers. If you drop the course, do so only after seeing through your current project. Please commit to the course by the time you are assigned to your final project group.

### Climate and Incident Reporting
We aim to create a class where students work respectfully with each other and feel they are treated equitably by our course staff. However, we acknowledge that may not always be the case.  

If you ever think that you (or another student) are being marginalized, excluded, or being treated disrespectfully, please fill out this EECS Student Climate & Incident Reporting Form. You are also more than welcome to reach out directly to Katherine, Hridhay, or Ace.  

Please note that as UC employees, all course instructors and tutors are “Responsible Employees” and are therefore required to report incidents of sexual violence, sexual harassment, or other conduct prohibited by University policy to the Title IX officer. Instructors and tutors cannot keep reports of sexual harassment or sexual violence confidential, but the Title IX officer will consider requests for confidentiality. Note that there are confidential resources available to you through UCB’s PATH to Care Center, which serves survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment; call their 24/7 Care Line at 510-643-2005.

## Academic Integrity
Design is difficult and requires a lot of time and energy. Do not discount the work that designers, both in our class and beyond, put into what they make. Please show the respect that you would like others to give your work. While collaboration, references, and resources are encouraged, passing off someone else’s work as your own will not be tolerated. If you use someone else’s work in any way (e.g., an icon library), you must include credit to them somewhere on your submitted file. Similarly, some assignments involve team collaboration. In these circumstances, your TA will be actively viewing your team’s file(s) and will be able to identify if you try to claim others’ work as your own. 

Any quiz, design, or report submitted by you and that bears your name is presumed to be your own original work that has not previously been submitted for credit in another course unless you obtain prior written approval to do so from the instructors. You may use words, images, or ideas authored by other individuals in publications, websites, or other sources, but only with proper attribution. If you are not clear about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking a quiz, be sure to ask the instructors. You should also keep in mind that as a member of the campus community you are expected to demonstrate integrity in all of your academic work and be evaluated on your own merits. The consequences of cheating and academic misconduct — including a formal discipline record and possible loss of future opportunities — are not worth the risk.

If you are feeling overwhelmed or highly stressed by the course requirements, please reach out to the instructors. Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated, and will get negative (not zero) points on the assignment. Please familiarize yourself with the UC Berkeley Student Code of Conduct. We expect all students and teaching staff to conduct themselves according to the UC Berkeley Honor Code.

## Getting Help

### Slack

We use Slack for online discussions and peer critiques. You can use it to ask questions about course concepts, assignments, and logistics. You should post publicly when possible (if you have a question about something, it's very likely that other students have the same question). You may also privately message any of the course staff via Slack as needed. If you privately ask a question that the course staff thinks might be relevant to the rest of the class, we may ask that you repost it in a public channel.

You are encouraged to respond to each others’ questions and comments! Please be respectful and help each other. Active Slack participation will be taken into account for borderline grades at the end of the summer.

Posts and messages sent on Slack after 9pm will likely not get a course staff response until the next day. Course staff may not be available Saturdays or Sundays.

### Office Hours
Office hours are posted on the [staff](../staff) page. If you cannot make anyone's posted office hours and need help, please reach out to us on Slack, and we will do our best to accommodate you. You may book office hours with Instructors for matters related to course logistics, group conflicts, conceptual discussions, readings, and personal concerns. For technical help or project-specific logistics, we recommend making an appointment with or going to a TA's office hours.

### Accommodations
UC Berkeley is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body including students with disabilities. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with the instructors.

If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you can work with the Disabled Students' Program (DSP) to request an official accommodation. The Disabled Students' Program (DSP) is the campus office responsible for authorizing disability-related academic accommodations, in cooperation with the students themselves and their instructors. You can find more information about DSP, including contact information and the application process, [here](dsp.berkeley.edu).

## Tips for Success
The best way to succeed in this course is to be genuinely excited about design and the field of Human-Computer Interaction! The goal is to learn techniques for user-centered interface design and development for you to create useful, effective, and interesting work. Here are a couple tips to help you get the most out of this course: 
* Remember that everyone moves at a different pace. Not everyone wants to use the skills learned in this class for the same things; determine your personal goals and interests, and approach our material through your unique lens.
* Pick up shortcuts as you go and share them. It’s more or less impossible for us to share every single possible trick with all the tools, but we will have a running library of tips for you to view and add to on Slack.
* Give and receive critique. Though there will be classes dedicated to this topic, we encourage you to engage in crit outside of class as well. Critique is not meant to be disheartening or intimidating! It can and should be a source of fresh perspectives and inspiration.
* Attend and keep up with demos and hands-on experience provided during lectures and labs. Working on an actual project file is the best and most efficient way to familiarize yourself with the technical tools and build your mechanical skill set.
* Browse and share resources from outside of class. For example, you can browse Figma Community, a built-in part of Figma where creators share their works to the public. Spend some time looking at what’s possible and learning how Figma can be used in creative ways.
* Please reach out to us (Slack is best)! We understand students may be struggling to keep up with schoolwork when they have other, more pressing, worries. We want you to succeed and pursue your own ideas beyond this course, and we’re here to help.

**UC Berkeley Basic Needs Food Pantry**  
The UC Berkeley [Basic Needs Food Pantry](https://basicneeds.berkeley.edu/pantry) (#68 Martin Luther King Student Union) aims to reduce food insecurity among students and staff at UC Berkeley, especially the lack of nutritious food. Students and staff can visit the pantry as many times as they need and take as much as they need while being mindful that it is a shared resource. The pantry operates on a self-assessed need basis; there are no eligibility requirements. The pantry is not for students and staff who need supplemental snacking food, but rather, core food support.

The academic counseling, legal support, financial aid resources and extensive campus referral network provided by USP helps students develop the unique gifts and talents they each bring to the university, while empowering a sense of belonging. The program’s mission is to support the advancement of undocumented students within higher education and promote pathways for engaged scholarship.
