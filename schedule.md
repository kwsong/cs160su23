# Schedule

Note: Topics and readings may change slightly. We will make every effort to post the links to lecture slides before the beginning of the class they are introduced.

For ease of access, we list direct links to all lecture slides and project materials. All other important forms, links, and resources are available on the bCourses homepage and pinned to the #resources-and-links channel in Slack.
